# Path-Count-Problem-and-Minimum-Cost-Path-Problem-using-Dynamic-Programming-in-C-


TThe Path Count Problem involves finding the number of possible paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a grid. In this problem, you are allowed to move only right or down at each step. Dynamic Programming can be used to efficiently solve this problem. By creating a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the number of paths to reach cell (i, j) in the grid, and initializing the first row and first column to 1, you can iteratively fill up the dp array. The value in each cell is calculated by adding the number of paths from the cell above and the cell to the left. The result is stored in dp[n-1][m-1], where n and m are the number of rows and columns respectively. This approach ensures that you count all possible paths from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
